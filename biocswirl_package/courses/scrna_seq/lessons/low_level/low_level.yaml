#Introduction

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to BiocSwirl - Terminal based Bioconductor Courses. This lesson will cover how to install required packages, loading scRNA data and exploring various visualization methods, and processing raw reads.

- Class: text
  Output: Install the required software at the following link, https://github.com/lisancao/biocswirl/blob/master/biocswirl_dev/devenv_install.

#Explain alignment

- Class: text
  Output: To generate the count and RPKM data, 100bp single-end reads were aligned using RSEM to the mm10 mouse genome build with the RefSeq annotation downloaded on 11 June 2013. Raw fastq files are available at Gene Expression Omnibus, accession ID GSE71585.

#Alignment QC

- Class: text
  Output: Before downstream processing of aligned reads (.bam) in R, we must assess the quality of the alignments.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What tool can we use to quality check the aligned .bam files?
  AnswerChoices: FastQC;samtools;STAR;DESeq2
  CorrectAnswer: FastQC
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='FastQC')

- Class: text
  Output: Go to https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ and follow instructions to perform QC on .bam files.

#Load data into R

- Class: text
  Output: Now that we have good quality alignment files, let's load our data into R. First, let's install bioconductor and the required packages.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In the R console, enter (without asterisks) *if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install()*
  CorrectAnswer: if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install()')
  Hint: Type the expression into the R console.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Install the packages ___.
  CorrectAnswer: BiocManager::install(c("___"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='BiocManager::install(c("___"))')
  Hint: Refer to the bioconductor install page. Use quotations.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Load the installed packages.
  CorrectAnswer: library("")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library("")')
  Hint: Load each library separately.

- Class: text
  Output: Set working directory.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Input the .csv metadata file.
  CorrectAnswer: read_csv("cell_metadata.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='read_csv("cell_metadata.csv")')
  Hint: Use tidyverse.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What are the dimensions of the metadata table?
  AnswerChoices: 1680,16;16,1679;16,1680;1679,16; none of the above
  CorrectAnswer: 1679,16
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1679,16')
  Hint: Rows first, then columns.

- Class: text
  Output: Confirm whether your data was imported correctly using the head() function.
