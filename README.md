# biocswirl
 BiocSwirl() aims to make learning bioinformatics interactive through highly technical and easily updateable terminal-style courses. You will be taken through an entire workflow using R/Bioconductor and learn the differences between file formats, good coding practices, and troubleshooting through feedback on your code. In Hackseq 2019 we focussed on scRNA-seq.
